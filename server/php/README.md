# PHP firmware server

I wrote a little „management“ Tool. I use it with Mysql Admin. Just two tables with device Id’s and Files in the database attached.
If you like you can contribute it to you repository. I guess that’s where most people will see it. 

Also I had to comment the lines 290 through 297 in order to get it to work. 

Hope this scrip helps some people.
